# Flappy Dabloons

A meme-style Flappy Bird-inspired game with a twistâ€”collect dabloons, visit the shop, and survive evil meme birds.  
Slightly inspired by Polymars. Made by Marcel/GAMERABLE and ChatGPT (because I'm bad at coding actual games).

## Features
- Meme-styled graphics and sound effects
- Shop with upgrades and skins
- Dabloon currency system
- Simple tap/flap gameplay
- Casino (coming soon)

## How to Play
- Tap/click to flap.
- Dodge pipes and collect dabloons.
- Use dabloons to buy upgrades in the shop after death.

## Credits
Made by Marcel/GAMERABLE with help from ChatGPT  
Textures, memes, and sounds sourced fairly for parody use.
